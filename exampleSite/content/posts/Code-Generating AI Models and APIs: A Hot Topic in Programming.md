Code-generating AI models and AI-friendly APIs are gaining popularity in the programming community. Forbes recently published an article discussing five AI tools that can generate code to assist programmers. These tools are designed to help developers automate repetitive coding tasks and improve productivity.

One notable project in this space is BigCode, an open scientific collaboration that focuses on developing large language models for code on Twitter. BigCode aims to create tools that can assist programmers in writing better code, by utilizing the power of AI and machine learning.

Another tool that has been making headlines is PolyCoder, an open-source code-generating AI that researchers claim can outperform OpenAI's Codex. PolyCoder uses an AI model that is trained on a vast amount of code from open-source repositories and can generate code based on user input. This means that developers can write code faster and more efficiently, while also reducing the likelihood of errors.

The rise of code-generating AI models and APIs is changing the way developers work. With the help of these tools, programmers can focus on more complex tasks, while automating repetitive coding tasks. As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more innovative tools and solutions in the programming community.
